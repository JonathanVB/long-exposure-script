# long-exposure-script
A couple simple scripts to turn a video into a long exposure or star-trail. Theres's a few commented out lines which can be used to create an additive video of the time lapse.

# dependancies
They're just python scripts. In detail:

* Install python 3.x
* Install python's imageio library: (`python -m pip install imageio`)
* Run the .py script with the video as the first parameter, and the output image as the second (`python <script_name>.py <video-file> <image-to-be-created>`
